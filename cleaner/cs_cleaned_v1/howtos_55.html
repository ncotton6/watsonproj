<p>You can find RIT's offical password policy <a href="http://security.rit.edu/password.html" rel="nofollow">here</a>.</p> Changing your DCS password 
<p>You must be logged on to one of the Linux machines in the department. You must use the 'cspasswd' program found in /usr/local/dcs/bin. (this will be in your default path if you have not changed your dot-files)</p> 
<p><br> If you can not remember your CS password you must visit the System Admin office found in room 70-3590.<br> We <b>WILL NOT</b> give you passwords over the phone or through email.<br> Any problems or questions you have can be sent to <a href="mailto:problems@cs.rit.edu" rel="nofollow">problems@cs.rit.edu</a></p> Password Strength 
<p>At this time the Department of Computer Science requires you password to be:</p> 
<ul> 
 <li>At least 8 characters long, 12 or more is recommended.</li> 
 <li>Passwords must be made up of 3 of 4 character types (first and last characters do not count towards the total): 
  <ol> 
   <li>uppercase letters</li> 
   <li>lowercase letters</li> 
   <li>numbers</li> 
   <li>punctuation characters</li> 
  </ol></li> 
 <li>not containing any dictionary words if it is less than 12 characters long.</li> 
</ul>     Remote Connections    
<span><a rel="nofollow">Using puTTY</a> </span>    Getting PuTTY 
<p>PuTTY is a free SSH client available from <a href="http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/%7Esgtatham/putty/download.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/download.html</a> From that page you can download either just the putty.exe program or a full set of SSH utilities including file transfer and key generation. Note that PuTTYtel will not work to connect to the CS department, as we do not support telnet connections.</p> Quick Connection 
<p>When you launch the PuTTY.exe program, it shows a configuration screen with many options. However, most of them can be left at their defaults. To connect to a CS department computer, enter the fully qualified domain name (example: <code>newyork.cs.rit.edu</code>) in the text box labeled "Host Name (or IP address)". You can then click the "Open" button to connect. The first time you connect to a host, it will display a security alert. You can usually click "Yes" and it will remember the host key and not prompt the next time you connect (see below for more details). After it connects, it will prompt for your username and password.</p> 
<p>When connecting to a host for the first time or for the first time after a host's SSH keys (these are not your personal keys, but the keypair that identifies a particular computer system) have been rebuilt, you will be prompted with a message similar to:</p> 
<blockquote> 
 <p>The server's host key is not cached in the registry. You have no guarantee that the server is the computer you think it is. The server's rsa2 key fingerprint is: ssh-rsa 1024 03:90:56:97:64:e4:e3:24:12:ed:f8:a8:7e:04:1f:46 If you trust this host, hit Yes to add the key to PuTTY's cache and carry on connecting. If you want to carry on connecting just once, without adding the key to the cache, hit No. If you do not trust this host, hit Cancel to abandon the connection.</p> 
</blockquote> 
<p>In general it is perfectly safe to hit Yes at this prompt. If you know the SSH keys on a host have not changed (this is most applicable to users running Unix at home) but you are being prompted with a message similar to the above, please contact the Admins immediately.</p> Saving a Session 
<p>To avoid having to type in a host and your user name every time, you can save the settings as a session. To do so, enter in a host name and set any additional settings (such as username under the "Connection/Data" category), then enter a name under "Saved Sessions" (in the main "Session" category) and press "Save". From then on, you can simply double-click the session name in the list to connect to that machine. You can use the "Load" button to bring up the settings in order to change them and then save them again under the same name or a new one.</p> Generating SSH Keys 
<p>PuTTY also comes with a program named PuTTYgen to generate SSH public and private keys. You can use these keys to authenticate instead of using your password.</p>      
<span><a rel="nofollow">Using SSH/SCP/SFTP</a> </span>    General Disclaimer 
<p>This is not a guide on how to use SSH/SCP/SFTP or any mail or news programs. There are far too many programs to write a comprehensive guide on each. Instead, this will serve as a general usage and configuration primer for the programs most readily available in the Department of Computer Science at R.I.T. All systems in the Computer Science Department are configured to use SSH2 only. There are a number of well-documented security vulnerabilities of SSH1 that SSH2 is immune to, so fallback to SSH1 has also been disabled.</p> 
<p>Valid machines for general use are all student labs (ICLs 1-4) and the general access SMPs. When you are in a lab you will see name tags on each system; simply append '<span>.cs.rit.edu</span>' to the name for the fully-qualified DNS name. For example, the host <span>idaho</span> is really <span>idaho.cs.rit.edu</span>.<br><br> One machine not in labs that is a valid connection point is glados. This is a larger system available for general computing use, living in the Computer Science machine room.<br><br> When connecting to a host for the first time or for the first time after a host's SSH keys (these are not your personal keys, but the keypair that identifies a particular computer system) have been rebuilt, you will be prompted with a message similar to:</p>  
<br> 
<span>The authenticity of host '<span>{hostname}</span> (<span>{host IP address}</span>)' can't be established.</span> 
<br> 
<span>RSA key fingerprint is 03:90:56:97:64:e4:e3:24:12:ed:f8:a8:7e:04:1f:46.</span> 
<br> 
<span>Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)? </span>  
<p><br> In general it is perfectly safe to accept this prompt. If you <span>know</span> the SSH keys on a host have not changed (this is most applicable to users running Unix at home) but you are being prompted with a message similar to the above, please contact the Admins immediately.</p> Authentication with SSH  SSH supports multiple user authentication techniques. The two employed by the CS department are password-based and public/private key-based.  
<a rel="nofollow"></a>Using Password Authentication  This is the default technique; simply follow the directions for connecting to a CS host below. When connecting, you will be prompted for your password.  
<a rel="nofollow"></a>Using Public/Private Keys for Authentication  This technique requires the building and distribution of SSH keys. 
<br> 
<br> Note that this method is generally not available for Windows systems. The password authentication technique is sufficient. 
<br> 
<br> The command 
<span>ssh-keygen</span> should already be in your path. 
<br> 
<br> The default behavior of the SSH key generator is to build 1024-bit RSA keys for SSH verison 2. 
<br> 
<br> 
<a rel="nofollow"></a>Building &amp; Using SSH Keys 
<br>  
<ol> 
 <li>At the Unix shell, enter the following command: <p><span>$&gt; ssh-keygen -b <span>[1024 | 2048]</span> -t rsa {enter} </span></p> where you choose either 1024- or 2048-bit key length (longer keys = greater security at cost of greater computation time and effort). <p>When prompted for a passphrase, it is important that you not leave this blank. It is also best to not make this passphrase the same as your password. Using your password as the key passphrase is essentially identical to using password authentication.</p> <p>This will create a file pair <span>~/.ssh/id_rsa</span> and <span>~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub</span>. The <span>id_rsa.pub</span> file is your public key, the file without the extention is your private key.</p> </li> 
 <li>At the Unix shell, enter the following command: <p><span>$&gt; ssh-keygen -b <span>[1024 | 2048]</span> -t dsa {enter} </span></p> where you choose either 1024- or 2048-bit key length (again, longer keys = greater security at cost of greater computation time and effort). Also, note the algorithm difference (the first invocation generated RSA keys, this builds DSA keys). <p>When prompted for a passphrase, it is important that you not leave this blank. It is also best to not make this passphrase the same as your password. Using your password as the key passphrase is essentially identical to using password authentication. For simplicities sake, this can be the same as your RSA keypair, but additional security is gained (in the sense that for full compromise of your keypairs it would require crack two passphrases, not just one) by making the two passphrases different.</p> <p>This will create a file pair <span>~/.ssh/id_dsa</span> and <span>~/.ssh/id_dsa.pub</span>. The <span>id_dsa.pub</span> file is your public key, the file without the extention is your private key.</p> </li> 
</ol>   When you distribute keypairs keep these points in mind: 
<br> 
<ul> 
 <li>In the CS department, all systems have a common filesystem. This means that in effect, for every two CS systems you move between, your SSH keys are already distributed.</li> 
 <li>File system permissions on both the public and private keys should be 0600 (readable and writable by you <span>only</span>).</li> 
 <li>If you want to connect to the CS systems from home, generate keys at home the same way as above, and simply copy your public key file to the CS systems. This is not a simple copy; it is important to follow these directions: 
  <ul> 
   <li>Say on the CS systems you have your public/private keypairs. When importing a new public key, save the new public key as a separate file.</li> 
   <li>Enter the following command to import a new public key: <p><span>$&gt; cat <span>{new public key file name}</span> &gt;&gt; ~/.ssh/authorized_keys {enter}</span></p> </li> 
   <li>You should now be able to hop between hosts and authenticate using your SSH passphrase.</li> 
  </ul></li> 
</ul>    Now when using SSH you will not be prompted for your password but rather the passphrase you entered when generating the keys. This can be further simplified by using SSH agents. Depending on the authentication method chosen by the SSH handshake process, this is using either RSA or DSA keys; if your passphrase is different for each keypair, this will matter. SSH will default to RSA keys first, and then moving to DSA keys.&nbsp; For more on this, see the Resources section. 
<br> 
<br> 
<span><a rel="nofollow"></a>So, Instead of My Password I Have a Passphrase -- Why Bother?<br><br></span>  This point could be argued either way, but perhaps the most appropriate point is separation of authority. If one password is used everywhere, this is a single point of failure. If you use a password or second passphrase to log onto the CS systems, and then a different passphrase to move between the department (this scenario as follows: connecting to the CS department from home with SSH keypair A or via password authentication, and using SSH keypair B within the department), this is two levels of security.  
<br> 
<span><a rel="nofollow"></a> General Notes on Authentication<br></span> 
<br>  Keys are the prefered method of authentication. As mentioned above, RSA keys are first tried, then DSA keys. If keys are non-existant or fail authentication (incorrect passphrase, etc), password-based authentication is used.   
<br> 
<br> 
<a rel="nofollow"></a>Connecting to a Machine Via SSH from OS X/Unix  Provided you have a CS account, from a Unix shell enter either of the following commands at a shell prompt:   
<br> 
<span>$&gt; ssh <span>{username}</span>@<span>{machine name}</span> {enter}</span> 
<br> 
<br> or 
<br> 
<br> 
<span> $&gt; ssh -l <span>{username} {machine name}</span> {enter}<br><br></span>   where 
<span>{machine name}</span> is either a fully qualified DNS name (eg. 
<span>tin.cs.rit.edu</span>) if you're connecting from outside the department, or just the hostname (eg. 
<span>tin</span>) if you're connecting from within. 
<br> 
<br> If you're connecting two systems on which you have the same username, (ie, between two CS systems) you may ommit the 
<span>{username}</span> field; it defaults to the username you are currently using. 
<br> 
<br> Use the default SSH port (TCP port 22) when connecting. 
<br> 
<br> This technique works equally well for any other Solaris, Linux, or other Unix variant Operating System.  
<br> 
<a rel="nofollow"></a>Connecting to a Machine Via SSH from Windows  
<span>Prerequisites:</span>  
<ol> 
 <li>CS account</li> 
 <li>SSH client for your version of Windows; suggested clients are: 
  <ul> 
   <li>PuTTY [ <a href="http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/%7Esgtatham/putty/" rel="nofollow">http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/</a> ]</li> 
   <li>SSH [<a href="http://ssh.com/products/infrastructure/client-server/" rel="nofollow"> http://ssh.com/products/infrastructure/client-server/</a> ]</li> 
   <li>SecureCRT [ <a href="http://www.vandyke.com/products/securecrt/" rel="nofollow">http://www.vandyke.com/products/securecrt/</a> ]</li> 
  </ul></li> 
</ol>  
<br> Configure your client to connect using your CS username to a valid CS Department host. As with the Unix variants, your host specification is either a fully qualified DNS name (eg 
<span>newyork.cs.rit.edu</span>) if you're connecting from outside the department, or just the hostname (eg 
<span>newyork</span>) if you're connecting from within. 
<br> 
<br> Use the default SSH port (TCP port 22) when connecting (there may be an option to change this value; leave it as is).   Getting a Windowing Environment -- When a Shell Isn't Enough  The above products will provide a secure shell, which does not permit multiple windows (eg, you won't be able to start emacs and maintain your shell window). If this is a desirable feature you will need to have an X Server running on your local machine. Please check out these How Tos:

 <li>OS OX machines need to use 'ssh -Y <i><a href="mailto:username@hostname" rel="nofollow">username@hostname</a></i>' instead.</li> 
</ul>     Using SCP and SFTP  These programs operate as a subset of the SSH package, and therefore are restricted to the hosts and protocols as mentioned above. 
<br> 
<br> 
<span><a rel="nofollow"></a>One Important Caveat About SCP and SFTP:</span> 
<br>  
<br> If excessive information is echoed to the terminal during login (from the 
<span>.login</span> or 
<span>.bashrc</span>/ 
<span>.cshrc</span> files), these two programs will not work. RationalRose, as used in CS4 and CS for Transfer classes, also causes these programs to fail as they echo information to the terminal window. 
<br> 
<br> Simply commenting out the appropriate lines in these files will allow SCP and SFTP to operate cleanly. 
<br> 
<br> In your 
<span>.cshrc</span> or 
<span>.bash_profile</span> file, a line similar to: 
<br> 
<br>  
<span>source /usr/local/RationalRose/rs_setup.csh</span>  
<br> exists; inserting a pound sign ( 
<span>#</span>) before this line will comment it out and prevent its execution.   SCP scp works like the unix 'cp' command, except it copies from between hosts. 
<br> A simple syntax (man scp for more options): 
<pre>scp [ [user@]host1:]file1 []... [ [user@]host2:]file2
</pre> If user or host is omitted, it assumes your userid and local host. 
<br> example: 
<pre>scp file1 username@holly.cs.rit.edu:/full-path-to-home/file2
</pre> This will copy file1 from your current machine and directory to /full-path-to-home/file2 through the machine holly. You will be required to authenticate as 
<i>username</i> for the process to succeed. SFTP SFTP works the same as traditional ftp, except over a secure connection. To use it, just connect to any of the lab machines. 
<br> Example: 
<pre>sftp newyork.cs.rit.edu
</pre> After authenticating, you will be connected to your home directory. See the man page for sftp for more details. 
<br> 
<a rel="nofollow"></a>Advanced: Using ssh-agent from OSX/Unix Using ssh-agent can greatly increase automation when working on a distributed project while continuing to be secure. It allows you to use a passphrase protected ssh generated key without having to type in the password each time. This is done by starting a process that will act as a password proxy for your current shell session. This process is separate from the shell you invoke it from: it will be important that you kill that process before you close the shell. Otherwise, you will leave orphaned ssh-agent processes behind 
<br> To get ssh-agent to work for you, you must already have ssh keys generated (see 
<a href="http://www.cs.rit.edu/resources/computing/HOWTOs/SSH_HOWTO#Auth-Keys" rel="nofollow">Using Public/Private Keys for Authentication</a> ). 
<ol> 
 <li>Open up a shell window on your Unix machine.</li> 
 <li>Depending on what your default shell is, you will need to start ssh-agent 
  <ul> 
   <li>If using bash, dash, or sh, <span>eval 'ssh-agent -s'</span>. (the ' is important here)</li> 
   <li>If you use csh, tcsh, <span>eval 'ssh-agent -c'</span></li> 
  </ul> This will take the output of the ssh-agent command as commands to be run. In this case, they will be values set in your shell. This will give your current shell session the information it needs to use the ssh-agent as a proxy.</li> 
 <li>You will be able to now add an ssh key to the agent for proxy. <span>ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa</span> (or id_dsa, or whatever name you gave your ssh keys). It will ask you for the passphrase. Type this in to unlock the key and add it to the agent.</li> 
 <li>You can now use ssh to reach other machines with that key, and not require you to type in that passphrase each time.</li> 
 <li>NOTE: When you are done with the current shell and logging off, please kill the process of the agent. It can be found typing <span>echo $SSH_AGENT_PID</span></li> 
 <li>NOTE: Only the shell that has the SSH_AUTH_SOCK and SSH_AGENT_PID variables set will have access to the agent. Unless you chose to add them by hand to other shell sessions, only the shell session you ran <span>eval 'ssh-agent -s'</span> will have a connection to the agent.</li> 
</ol>       
<span><a rel="nofollow">Using SVN</a> </span>    
<p>This FAQ explains how to set up a Subversion repository in your account, how to set up projects, and how to access the repository remotely.</p> 
<p>For information about how to use Subversion, please see the documentation at <a href="http://subversion.tigris.org/" rel="nofollow">http://subversion.tigris.org</a>. The on-line book available there is very good.</p> 
<ol> 
 <li>First, you need to add subversion to your path. By default this is already set up for use on Solaris machines. Add the following line to your .cshrc file:First, you need to add subversion to your path. Add the following line to your .cshrc file:<br><code>setenv PATH "${PATH}:/opt/csw/bin"</code><br> After you do this, you should run "<code>source .cshrc</code>" to update your <code>$PATH</code> variable.</li> 
 <br> 
 <li>Now, you must create a directory to hold your repository. For instance,<br><code>mkdir .svnrepository</code></li> 
 <br> 
 <li>Run the following command to create a repository inside the directory you just created.<br><code>svnadmin create .svnrepository</code><br> (NOTE: remember to replace "<code>.svnrepository</code>" with whatever directory name you chose in step 2.)</li> 
 <br> 
 <li>You now have a repository. There are two ways to create projects: create empty projects, or import preexisting code. 
  <ul> 
   <li>To create an empty project, make a directory, such as "<code>my_proj</code>" , to hold your working copy. From outside "<code>my_proj</code>", execute:<br><code>svn import -m "Blah blah" my_proj file://<i>path</i>/<i>to</i>/<i>repository</i>/.svnrepository/trunk</code><br> For instance:<br><code>svn import -m "Some comment" some_dir file:///home/stu10/s16/gjv2098/.svnrepository/trunk</code><br> (NOTE: this command will only work locally. See below for remote access details.)</li> 
   <br> 
   <li>If you have a folder already containing source that you wish to import into the repository, you can execute the above command with the name of the existing directory replacing "<code>my_proj</code>".</li> 
   <br> 
  </ul></li> 
 <br> 
 <li>In order to remotely access your repository, you must tell subversion to execute through ssh. Let's say you have a project called "<code>my_proj</code>" in your subversion repository and you would like to check it out on a remote machine. Execute the following:<br><code>svn checkout svn+ssh://<i>username</i>@<i>machine</i>.cs.rit.edu/<i>path</i>/<i>to</i>/<i>repository</i>/.svnrepository/trunk my_proj</code><br> The "<code>svn+ssh</code>" portion tells subversion to run through ssh. Replace <code><i>username</i></code> with your username and <code><i>machine</i></code> with the name of a CS machine (e.g. holly). To find out the path to your home directory, log into a CS machine and execute "<code>pwd</code>". Executing the above command will create a directory called "<code>my_proj</code>" on the remote machine and fill it with the contents of the "<code>my_proj</code>" project.<br> In order for <code>svn+ssh</code> to work, you must first execute the following while logged into your account (this need only be done once):<br><code>mkdir ~/bin; ln -s /usr/local/subversion/bin/svnserve ~/bin/svnserve</code></li> 
 <br> 
 <li>A final note: <b>Your subversion login credentials are identical to your CS username and password. So, do NOT give these to anyone with the intention of sharing your repository, because you will be giving them access to your ENTIRE ACCOUNT.</b></li>

<span><a rel="nofollow">Using X11 with OS X</a> </span>    Installing X11 
<p>How to intall X11 depends on what version of OS X you have installed:</p> 
<dl> 
 <dt> 
  <b>10.2 and earlier</b> 
 </dt> 
 <dd>
   No official versions of X11 exist for these versions. 
 </dd> 
 <dt> 
  <b>10.3 (Panther)</b> 
 </dt> 
 <dd>
   X11 is available 
  <a href="http://support.apple.com/downloads/X11_for_Mac_OS_X_1_0" rel="nofollow">from Apple's website</a> 
 </dd> 
 <dt> 
  <b>10.4 (Tiger)</b> 
 </dt> 
 <dd>
   X11 is an optional installation from the Tiger DVD. 
 </dd> 
 <dt> 
  <b>10.5 (Leopard) and later</b> 
 </dt> 
 <dd>
   X11 is installed by default. 
 </dd> 
</dl>  Running X11 
<p>Recent versions of OS X will automatically launch X11 when a program attempts to connect to the X server. Open Terminal.app and try running <code>xterm</code>. If that doesn't work, you'll need to start X11 manually. It can be found in <code>/Applications/Utilities</code>.</p> Using X programs from the CS machines 
<p>Using the Terminal or an xterm, use <code>ssh -Y <i>username</i>@<i>hostname</i></code> to connect to a CS machine. Once logged in, you may use programs as normal. For example running <code>emacs</code> should open the emacs window on your computer.</p>
