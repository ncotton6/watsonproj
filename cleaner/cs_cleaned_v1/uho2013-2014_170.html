<a rel="nofollow"></a> 2013-2014 Undergraduate Handbook         2013-2014 Undergraduate Handbook     Disclaimer:
<br> 
<br> Beginning with fall semester, 2013, RIT began operating on a semester-based calendar; prior to this, RIT operated on a quarter-based calendar. Links on this web site directing users to sections under quarters are primarily for historical interest. Some information (such as forms or documents) contained in sections about quarters may no longer be accurate. Some information in sections about quarters is no longer applicable (such as the form used by undergraduates to request permission to take a graduate CS class). Some information contained in sections about quarters may or may not apply to particular students (for example, transition students who began their degree program under quarters, but who plan to complete their degree program under semesters). Students should confirm with their academic advisor which information, documents, or forms apply to their specific case. Preface 
<p>We have tried our best in this “handbook” to provide accurate, complete, and helpful information.&nbsp; It is important for students to realize, however, that there is much more beyond what we have stated.&nbsp; In particular, RIT, the college (GCCIS), and the department (Computer Science) follow or implement numerous institute policies and procedures.&nbsp; A great deal of information is available to students through various sources, many of which are online, but it is also unrealistic to expect that all students will be aware of all the policies that pertain to them.&nbsp; Different issues will come up at different times and not all issues will apply to every student.&nbsp; We urge you to frequently consult or contact your academic advisor as well as the staff in the department’s Student Services Office to confirm or clarify your understanding when such issues do arise.&nbsp; If individuals from Computer Science do contact you or communicate with you, please make sure you understand the message, acknowledge receipt of the message when asked to do so, or raise questions when something is not clear.</p> Documents

</ul> Advising - Getting Advice 
<p>The Department of Computer Science has professional academic advisors available to assist students, as well as to mentor and monitor students, especially during the first two years.<br> <br> A professional academic advisor has been assigned to you based on the first letter of your last name. Please be sure to view your current advisor assignment via the RIT Student Information System (SIS). The CS advisors rotate walk in advising hours during the week where you can swing by and get assistance without an appointment. If you would prefer an individual appointment, you can make one in advance by emailing your assigned academic advisor or by stopping by the CS Student Services Office. <b>Please, no same day appointments.</b><br> <br> In addition to scheduling an appointment with an advisor, students have the option to attend Walk-In Advising Hours in the CS Student Services Office. Walk-in hours operate on a first come, first served basis and allow students to meet with an advisor to address quick advising matters such as schedule changes/planning, worksheet questions, change of program out of Computer Science, course withdrawal, concerns with a course and co-op. If the advisor on duty determines your needs are beyond the scope of walk-in hours, you may be asked to make an appointment so we can provide you with the time to fully answer your questions. Advisors rotate walk-in hours, and students are encouraged to meet with whoever is on duty, not necessarily their assigned advisor. Additionally, only one advisor is on duty during walk-in hours so please be patient as there may be a wait, especially during busy times of the semester (Add/Drop, Registration, Course Withdrawal deadline). We will make every effort to get through as many students as possible before walk-in hours end. <b>There are no walk-in hours during final exams, break weeks, intersession, or during the summer.</b></p> 
<a rel="nofollow"><b>Academic Advisors</b></a> Faculty Advisors 
<p>While faculty advisors can discuss both academic and personal issues and address many of the same issues as the professional advisors, the real strength of faculty advisors lies in their professional expertise. Talk to your faculty advisor about career options, choices to make in selecting Computer Science or outside electives, or perhaps to get their opinion on several co-op opportunities that you have.</p> Program Coordinators 
<p>The Department of Computer Science has both an Undergraduate Program Coordinator and a Graduate Program Coordinator. For their respective programs, these individuals handle unusual situations with respect to degree requirements, approve exceptions, review co-op reports and assign co-op grades, verify that students can be certified for their degrees, and determine probation and suspension status. Coordinators are frequently called upon to sign off on most requests, from simple grade changes to change of program requests. Such requests are typically submitted through academic advisors or department staff. The Undergraduate Program Coordinator makes decisions and assigns credit for transfer courses as well as Advanced Placement, CLEP, and IB situations. Both coordinators are involved with the BS/MS program in Computer Science.</p>
