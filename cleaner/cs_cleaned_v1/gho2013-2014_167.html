</ul> The Curriculum 
<p>The graduate program of study consists of 30 semester credits. Students will select one of two tracks to the degree, the thesis track or the project track:<br><br><strong>The Core Course:</strong><br><br> • CSCI 665 Foundations of Algorithms (3 credits)<br><br><strong> The Thesis Track:</strong><br><br> • Three courses from a cluster (9 credits)<br> • Four electives (12 credits)<br> • Master’s Thesis (6 credits)<br><br><strong>The Project Track:</strong><br><br> • Three courses from a cluster (9 credits)<br> • Five electives (15 credits)<br> • Master’s Project/Colloquium (3 credits)<br><br><strong>Master Project or Thesis Track</strong><br><br> The topic of the project or thesis must come from the cluster the student has chosen. Only the Graduate Coordinator can approve an exception to this rule. For either track, students with a strong background in a core area may receive permission from the Graduate Coordinator to replace a core course with another course, generally in the same area. Only the Graduate Coordinator can approve changes of a student’s program of study.<br><br> The Master’s thesis or project forms the capstone of the MS program in Computer Science. It is a large body of work, which you undertake independently, but under the supervision of a full-time CS faculty member.<br><br><strong>Doing a MS Project/Thesis Related to Your Work</strong><br><br> A student may be working in the computing field, and find that their work provides them with an opportunity to do projects that are comparable to the MS Project or Thesis, and they would like that work to qualify. This approach is possible, and there is some precedent for doing it. MS Thesis students may even have a Reader from their place of employment, but the chair of their committee must be a Computer Science faculty member or an associated CS faculty and be knowledgeable in the proposed area of work. Faculty members involved in Project or on the Thesis committee must monitor the work that will be submitted as the Project or Thesis.<br><br> Because a CS faculty member is monitoring your work, this rules out submitting a proposal for work that has already been completed. In addition, the report, and a significant portion of the other work products such as code, must be made available for other students to read in the future. The committee sets the requirements - not the employer. It is your responsibility to assure that your employer’s requirements for confidentiality are respected.</p> MS Project Track 
<p>The MS Project capstone includes the three credit MS Project/Colloquium semester course that students should register for in the last term of their degree program. A project consists of a nontrivial software development effort and a report discussing it; or it is a report dealing with more theoretical questions. Original insight into a problem is desirable but not required. The project report is expected to be a scientific paper:<br><br> • describing background and relevant results in the area<br> • detailing the work carried out<br> • discussing the significance of the deliverables of the endeavor and providing appropriate reference citations<br><br> The final project presentation involves a poster presentation at the end of the semester course.<br><br><b>Deliverables:</b><br><br> The deliverables for the capstone project are a report, and a CD/DVD which has all the material related to the project on it. This may include source code, data files, readMe.txt, etc.</p>

<p>Any grade lower than “C” is considered failing. If a student receives a “D” or “F” they should meet with the graduate advisor as soon as possible to discuss the repercussions and create a recovery plan.</p> Co-op 
<p>Graduate students are eligible for co-op work consisting of two blocks/semesters of full-time employment. A co-op position is not assured. The co-op program is available for full-time students in good standing (cumulative GPA of 3.0 or better or a term GPA of 3.0 or better in the term immediately preceding the requested co-op term) who have completed the Bridge Program and at least 9 credits of the MS program of study.<br><br> Co-op positions must be secured by the beginning of the academic term that you wish to co-op. <strong>Permission for mid-semester co-ops will not be granted.</strong><br><br> To register for co-op, you must participate in a Co-op Orientation. Information may be obtained from the Co-op and Career Services Office.</p> Getting Advice - MS 
<p>Your advisor should be your first point of contact for assistance and advising. An academic advisor has been assigned to you based on the first letter of your last name. Please be sure to view your current advisor assignment via the RIT Student Information System (SIS).<br><br> To schedule an appointment, please call the Computer Science Student Services Office or stop by our office in GOL-3005. We do not do same day appointments, so please plan accordingly. Appointments are typically held between 9am-4pm.<br><br><strong>Advising appointments may be necessary to discuss the following:</strong><br><br> Schedule Changes and Planning<br> Curriculum Worksheet Questions<br> Change of Program Out of CS<br> Course Withdrawal<br> Concerns with a Course<br> Co-op<br> Full-time Equivalency<br> I-20 Extension<br> Reduced Course Load<br> Scholarship<br> Project/Thesis<br> Non-majors Interested in CS<br><br> Advisors are also available via email to answer questions. Advisors use your RIT email account as the primary means of contacting students. If you use another email, you should forward all your RIT mail to the account you check regularly.</p> 
<a rel="nofollow">Academic Advisors</a> Faculty Advisors 
<p>While faculty advisors can discuss both academic and personal issues and address many of the same issues as the professional advisors, the real strength of faculty advisors lies in their professional expertise. Talk to your faculty advisor about career options, choices to make in selecting Computer Science or outside electives, or perhaps to get their opinion on several co-op opportunities that you have.</p> Program Coordinators 
<p>The Department of Computer Science has both an Undergraduate Program Coordinator and a Graduate Program Coordinator. For their respective programs, these individuals handle unusual situations with respect to degree requirements, approve exceptions, review co-op reports and assign co-op grades, verify that students can be certified for their degrees, and determine probation and suspension status. Coordinators are frequently called upon to sign off on most requests, from simple grade changes to change of program requests. Such requests are typically submitted through academic advisors or department staff. The Undergraduate Program Coordinator makes decisions and assigns credit for transfer courses as well as Advanced Placement, CLEP, and IB situations. Both coordinators are involved with the BS/MS program in Computer Science.</p>
